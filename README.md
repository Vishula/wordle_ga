Here is a simple wordle game using HTML,CSS and JS  


[link to my Wordle](https://vishula.github.io/wordle_ga/)
 


## Issues 
Unfortunately I wasn't able to figure out how to color the boxes accordingly. I had trouble identifying the box ID to apply css styles. 
When user guesses the correct word, first row of grid will be highlighted green. 

## Future updates
In future update, I will add: 
1. Colors to the tiles and keyboard accordingly 
2. If user insert a invalid word, it will empty the whole row
3. Add keyboard access (keyup)
